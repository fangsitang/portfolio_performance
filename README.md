# Portfolio attribution

## Goal ✔️

* A key challenge in **_open architecture_** investing is to assess the performance of external portfolio managers 🤔💭.\
*→ Are they managing our funds well?\
→ Do they respect the investment mandate of the fund?\
→ Do we keep them, or find another portfolio manager?*
* Many metrics and models are used to answer these exact questions. Here, I'll demonstrate an application of the Brinson model.

## Brinson model 🧱

* Identifies whether or not strong performance relative to the benchmark is due to the portfolio manager's exceptional ability to pick securities, decision to overweight or underweight sectors, or BOTH.

## Attribution for different funds 🏦



## Sample code 👩🏻‍💻

Begin by cleaning datasets and retrieving all relevant data.
```python
#Get all relevant data
_data = {'start_date' : '2020-01-01',
         'end_date' : '2024-12-31',
         'bench_ticker' : "^GSPC", #benchmark ticker
         'fund_ticker' :"0P0001N8QM.TO", #fund ticker
         'tech' : "XLK", 
         'healthcare' :"XLV",
         'finance' : "XLF",
         'utilities':'XLU'
         }
```
After retrieving the portfolio, benchmark & sector returns, we find the allocation, selection and total effect.
```python
#Calculate allocation, selection & total effect

fund_sector_rets = sector_rets.mean() * fund_weights
bench_sector_rets = sector_rets.mean() * bench_weights

allocation_effect = np.sum( (fund_weights - bench_weights) * bench_sector_rets)

selection_effect = np.sum( (bench_weights * fund_sector_rets) * bench_sector_rets)

interaction_effect = np.sum( (fund_weights - bench_weights) * fund_sector_rets - bench_sector_rets)

total_effect = allocation_effect + selection_effect + interaction_effect
```
